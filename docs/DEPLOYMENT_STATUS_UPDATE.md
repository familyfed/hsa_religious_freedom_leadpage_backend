## ✅ **Deployment Completed Successfully**

The backend has been successfully redeployed to production with the updated Turnstile secret key configuration.

### **Deployment Details:**
- **Status:** ✅ Deployed successfully
- **URL:** `https://hsa-religious-freedom-leadpage-backend-57wd1y0xi.vercel.app`
- **Inspect:** `https://vercel.com/familyfed-104d194e/hsa-religious-freedom-leadpage-backend/5YTKpFU7skW9Kr6S3i7DpZ2svC1J`
- **Environment:** Production

## 🧪 **Post-Deployment Test Results**

### **✅ What's Working:**
- **Backend Basic Functionality:** ✅ Working perfectly
- **Test Token Bypass:** ✅ `test_token_123` works correctly
- **Stats Endpoint:** ✅ Working (6 confirmed, 11 pending, 17 total)
- **CORS Configuration:** ✅ Perfect for staging domain
- **API Endpoints:** ✅ All endpoints responding correctly

### **❌ What's Still Failing:**
- **Real Turnstile Tokens:** ❌ Still getting "Bot check failed"
- **Turnstile Verification:** ❌ Secret key may not be properly configured

---

## 🔍 **Turnstile Secret Key Status**

### **Current Situation:**
The real Turnstile token is still being rejected with "Bot check failed", which suggests:

1. **Secret Key Not Set:** The `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` environment variable may not be properly configured in Vercel
2. **Incorrect Secret Key:** The secret key value may be wrong
3. **Deployment Cache:** There may be a caching issue with the environment variables

### **Required Actions:**
1. **Verify Secret Key:** Check that `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` is properly set in Vercel
2. **Check Secret Key Value:** Ensure the secret key matches the site key `0x4AAAAAAB0JKe-utcVa1kuG`
3. **Force Redeploy:** May need to force a fresh deployment to pick up environment variables

---

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

### **Immediate Actions:**
1. **Check Vercel Environment Variables:**
   - Go to Vercel dashboard
   - Navigate to project settings
   - Check Environment Variables section
   - Verify `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` is set correctly

2. **Verify Secret Key Value:**
   - Ensure secret key matches the site key `0x4AAAAAAB0JKe-utcVa1kuG`
   - Secret key should be the corresponding secret for this site key

3. **Force Redeploy if Needed:**
   - If secret key is correct, force a fresh deployment
   - Environment variables may need to be refreshed

### **Testing:**
Once the secret key is properly configured, test with a fresh Turnstile token from the frontend.

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting Steps**

### **Step 1: Check Vercel Environment Variables**

2. Select the backend project
3. Go to Settings → Environment Variables
4. Verify `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` exists and is correct

### **Step 2: Verify Secret Key Value**

- Check Turnstile dashboard for the correct secret key

### **Step 3: Force Redeploy**
- If secret key is correct, force a fresh deployment
- Environment variables may need to be refreshed
