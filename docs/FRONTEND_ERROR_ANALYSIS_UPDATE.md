---

## 🎯 **Root Cause Analysis**

The **400 (Bad Request)** error on the frontend domain indicates:

1. **Frontend Domain Configuration Issue**
   - The domain `https://staging.petition.motherofpeace.com` is not properly configured
   - Vercel authentication or domain settings need adjustment
   - This is **NOT a backend issue**

2. **Backend is Working Perfectly**
   - All API endpoints are functional
   - CORS is properly configured
   - Rate limiting is working correctly
   - SSL certificates are valid

---

## 🚀 **What I've Accomplished**

### ✅ **Backend Fixes Completed**
1. **Rate Limiting Configuration**
   - **Before:** 3 requests/hour (too restrictive)
   - **After:** 100 requests/hour for staging
   - **Status:** ✅ Deployed and working

2. **Environment-Specific Configuration**
   - **Staging:** 100 requests/hour (permissive for development)
   - **Production:** 10 requests/hour (strict for security)
   - **Health Endpoint:** No rate limiting

3. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - ✅ All API endpoints tested
   - ✅ CORS configuration verified
   - ✅ SSL certificates validated
   - ✅ Rate limiting working correctly

## 📋 **Action Items**

### ✅ **Backend Team (Completed)**
- [x] Fix rate limiting configuration
- [x] Deploy updated configuration
- [x] Test all endpoints
- [x] Verify CORS settings
- [x] Document changes

### ❌ **Frontend Team (Needs Action)**

### **Backend API Tests (All Working)**
```bash
# Health check
curl "https://staging.api.petition.motherofpeace.com/health"
