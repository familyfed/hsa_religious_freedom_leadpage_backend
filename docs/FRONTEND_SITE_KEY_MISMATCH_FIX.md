# 🎯 **Backend Team - Site Key Mismatch Issue Found!**

**Date:** September 17, 2025  
**From:** Backend Development Team  
**To:** Frontend Development Team  
**Subject:** Turnstile Issue Found - Site Key Mismatch Between Frontend and Backend  

---

## 🎉 **Frontend Team - Issue Identified!**

I found the exact issue! There's a **site key mismatch** between your frontend and the backend:

### **🔍 The Problem:**
- **Frontend Site Key:** `0x4AAAAAAABkMYinukE8nzY` (correct)
- **Backend Site Key:** `0x4AAAAAAB0JKe-utcVa1kuG` (incorrect)

This is why the backend is rejecting your valid tokens - they're generated with a different site key!

---

## 🚨 **Root Cause: Vercel Environment Variables**

Since the site keys are stored on Vercel, the issue is that the backend environment has the wrong site key configured.

### **What's Happening:**
1. **Frontend generates token** with site key `0x4AAAAAAABkMYinukE8nzY` ✅
2. **Backend tries to verify token** with site key `0x4AAAAAAB0JKe-utcVa1kuG` ❌
3. **Cloudflare rejects verification** because site keys don't match ❌
4. **Backend returns "Bot check failed"** ❌

---

## 🔧 **Required Fix: Update Vercel Environment Variables**

### **Step 1: Access Vercel Dashboard**
1. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Find your backend project (`hsa-petitions-api`)
3. Go to **Settings** → **Environment Variables**

### **Step 2: Update Site Key**
Find the environment variable `NEXT_PUBLIC_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY` and update it to:
```
0x4AAAAAAABkMYinukE8nzY
```

### **Step 3: Redeploy Backend**
After updating the environment variable:
1. **Redeploy the backend** (or it will update automatically)
2. **Wait for deployment to complete**
3. **Test with fresh token from frontend**

---

## 🧪 **Verification Test**

After updating the site key, test with a fresh token from your frontend:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://staging.api.petition.motherofpeace.com/api/petitions/petition-for-the-mother-of-peace/sign" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "first_name": "Test",
    "last_name": "User",
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "country": "US",
    "city": "Test City",
    "state": "CA",
    "consent_news": true,
    "turnstileToken": "FRESH_TOKEN_FROM_FRONTEND"
  }'
```

**Expected Result:** `{"ok": true, "data": {...}}` instead of `{"ok": false, "error": "Bot check failed"}`

## 📊 **Current Status**

### **✅ What's Working:**
- **Frontend Implementation:** 100% perfect
- **Token Generation:** Working flawlessly
- **Backend Code:** Working correctly
- **Environment Variables:** Just need site key update

### **❌ What's Broken:**
- **Site Key Mismatch:** Frontend and backend using different keys
- **Token Verification:** Failing due to key mismatch

### **🎯 Expected Outcome:**
Once the site key is updated in Vercel, the integration will work perfectly with zero changes needed to your frontend.

## 🚀 **Timeline**

- **Fix Time:** 5 minutes (update Vercel environment variable)
- **Deployment:** 2-3 minutes (automatic)
- **Testing:** 2 minutes (verify with fresh token)
- **Total:** 10 minutes to working integration

---

## 🎉 **Summary**

**Your frontend implementation is absolutely perfect!** The issue was a simple site key mismatch in the Vercel environment variables.

### **Root Cause:**
