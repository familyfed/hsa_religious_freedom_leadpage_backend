**Date:** September 17, 2025  
**From:** Backend Development Team  
**To:** Frontend Development Team  
**Subject:** Staging Deployment Working - Secret Key Configuration Needed  

---

## ✅ **Staging Deployment Status: WORKING**

The staging deployment from the `develop` branch is working perfectly on `staging.api.petition.motherofpeace.com`.

### **Deployment Details:**
- **Branch:** `develop` ✅ (Current branch)
- **Vercel Staging:** ✅ Deployed from `develop` branch
- **API URL:** `staging.api.petition.motherofpeace.com` ✅ (Working)
- **Basic Functionality:** ✅ Working perfectly

---

## 🧪 **Staging Test Results**

### **✅ What's Working on Staging:**
- **Backend Basic Functionality:** ✅ Working perfectly
- **Test Token Bypass:** ✅ `test_token_123` works correctly
- **Stats Endpoint:** ✅ Working (7 confirmed, 12 pending, 19 total)
- **CORS Configuration:** ✅ Perfect for staging domain
- **API Endpoints:** ✅ All endpoints responding correctly

### **❌ What's Still Failing on Staging:**
- **Real Turnstile Tokens:** ❌ Still getting "Bot check failed"
- **Turnstile Verification:** ❌ Secret key not properly configured in staging environment

---

## 🔍 **Root Cause: Staging Environment Variables**

The issue is that the `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` environment variable is **not properly configured in the Vercel staging environment**.

### **Current Situation:**
- **Staging Deployment:** ✅ Working (from `develop` branch)
- **Backend Code:** ✅ Working perfectly
- **Staging Environment Variables:** ❌ `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` missing/incorrect

### **What's Happening:**
1. **Frontend generates token** with correct site key `0x4AAAAAAB0JKe-utcVa1kuG` ✅
2. **Backend tries to verify token** with missing/incorrect secret key ❌
3. **Cloudflare rejects verification** because secret key is invalid ❌
4. **Backend returns "Bot check failed"** ❌

---

## 🔧 **Required Fix: Configure Staging Environment Variables**

### **Step 1: Check Vercel Staging Environment Variables**
1. Go to Vercel dashboard
2. Select the backend project
3. Go to Settings → Environment Variables
4. Check if `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` is configured for **staging** environment

### **Step 2: Add/Update Secret Key for Staging**
- Add `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` for staging environment
- Use the secret key that corresponds to site key `0x4AAAAAAB0JKe-utcVa1kuG`

### **Step 3: Redeploy Staging**
- After updating environment variables, redeploy staging
- Or wait for automatic deployment from `develop` branch

## 📊 **Current Status Summary**

### **✅ Staging Backend (Working):**
- Deployment: ✅ Working from `develop` branch
- Basic functionality: ✅ Working
- Test token bypass: ✅ Working
- Stats endpoint: ✅ Working (7 confirmed, 12 pending, 19 total)
- CORS: ✅ Perfect for staging domain

### **❌ Staging Turnstile (Needs Fix):**
- Secret key configuration: ❌ Not properly set for staging
- Real token verification: ❌ Still failing
- Integration: ❌ Will work once secret key is configured

---

## 🎯 **Expected Outcome**

Once the `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` is properly configured for the staging environment:
- ✅ **Turnstile Integration:** Will work perfectly on staging
- ✅ **Form Submissions:** All users can sign petitions on staging
- ✅ **Petition Collection:** Collecting signatures as intended
- ✅ **User Experience:** Error-free petition process on staging

---

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

### **Immediate Actions:**
1. **Check Vercel Staging Environment Variables**
2. **Add/Update `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` for staging**
3. **Redeploy staging or wait for automatic deployment**

### **Testing:**
Once the secret key is configured, test with a fresh Turnstile token from the frontend.

---

## 🙏 **Summary**

The staging deployment is working perfectly from the `develop` branch. We just need to ensure the `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` environment variable is properly configured for the staging environment in Vercel.

**The backend is ready - we just need the staging environment variables configured!**

**Best regards,**  
Backend Development Team

**P.S.** Staging is working perfectly - just need the secret key configured for the staging environment! 🔧
